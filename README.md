# Bilal Arshad — Portfolio

My personal portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed.
```bash
npm install

```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Editing Content

All site content (bio, projects, skills, experience etc.) lives in `data/profile.ts` — just edit the text values in there.

## Deploying

Hosted on Vercel. Any push to main automatically redeploys.
